        <h2>Welcome to Laundry Mart</h2>
        <p>A Laundry Mart is a dedicated service for cleaning, drying, and ironing clothes, often blending traditional expertise with modern convenience. In many South Asian communities, the "wallah" refers to a skilled individual who handles garments with care, often using time-tested methods to preserve fabric quality. Modern Laundry Marts, on the other hand, are self-service or full-service laundromats equipped with washing machines, dryers, and sometimes express services for busy customers. These spaces often serve as community hubs where locals drop off laundry, exchange greetings, and trust their clothes to capable hands. Whether traditional or modern, both share the same goalâ€”returning clothes fresh, spotless, and ready to wear.</p>
